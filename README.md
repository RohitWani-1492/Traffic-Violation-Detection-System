# SafeRide: Automatic Detection of Traffic Violations using YOLOv11-Based Object Detection

## INTRODUCTION

### Motivation 
- Road safety violations like riding without helmets or triple-seat riding are major contributors to traffic accidents.
- Manual enforcement is often ineffective due to limited manpower and high traffic density.
- Technological advancements in AI and object detection offer opportunities for automated monitoring.
- Automation can reduce human error, ensure consistent rule enforcement, and improve response time.
- Developing a smart system can assist authorities in promoting road safety and reducing accident rates.

### Problem Statement
- Manual traffic monitoring struggles to detect frequent violations such as non-helmet usage and triple-seat riding.
- Many offenders go unnoticed, especially in busy zones with limited enforcement coverage.
- There is a need for a reliable, real-time system to track and report violations automatically.
- Lack of timely action often leads to preventable accidents and fatalities.
- An efficient detection and alert system is essential to support law enforcement and enhance road safety.

### SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES
- Detect two-wheelers violating traffic rules in real-time. 
- Recognize absence of helmets and triple riding. 
- Extract vehicle number plate data for offender identification. 
- Build an end-to-end pipeline using deep learning models.
